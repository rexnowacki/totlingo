Although each of the worlds countries

  
would like to dispute this fact

  
we French know the truth

  
The best food in the world
is made in France

  
The best food in France
is made in Paris

  
And the best food in Paris some say
is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau

  
Gusteaus restaurant
is the toast of Paris

  
booked five months in advance

  
And his dazzling ascent
to the top of fine French cuisine

  
has made his competitors envious

  
He is the youngest chef ever
to achieve a fivestar rating

  
Chef Gusteaus cookbook
Anyone Can Cook

  
Climbed to the top of the bestseller list

  
But not everyone
celebrates its success

  
Amusing title Anyone Can Cook

  
Whats even more amusing is that
Gusteau actually seems to believe it

  
I on the other hand
take cooking seriously

  
And no I dont think anyone can do it

  
This is me

  
I think its apparent
I need to rethink my life a little bit

  
Whats my problem

  
First of all Im a rat

  
Which means life is hard

  
And second I have a highly developed
sense of taste and smell

  
Flour eggs sugar vanilla bean

  
Oh Small twist of lemon

  
Whoa you can smell all that
You have a gift

  
This is Emile my brother
Hes easily impressed

  
So you can smell ingredients
So what

  
This is my dad Hes never impressed

  
He also happens to be
the leader of our clan

  
So whats wrong
with having highly developed senses

  
 Dont eat that
 Whats going on here

  
Turns out that funny smell
was rat poison

  
Suddenly Dad didnt think
my talent was useless

  
I was feeling pretty good about my gift

  
until Dad gave me a job

  
Clean

  
Clean

  
Thats right Poison checker

  
Cleanerific

  
Cleanerino

  
Close to godliness

  
Which means clean
You know cleanliness is close to

  
Never mind Move on

  
Well it made my dad proud

  
Now dont you feel better Remy
Youve helped a noble cause

  
Noble Were thieves Dad

  
And what were stealing is
lets face it garbage

  
It isnt stealing if no one wants it

  
If no one wants it
why are we stealing it

  
Lets just say
we have different points of view

  
This much I knew

  
If you are what you eat
then I only want to eat the good stuff

  
But to my dad

  
Food is fuel

  
You get picky about what you put
in the tank your engine is gonna die

  
Now shut up and eat your garbage

  
Look if were going to be thieves

  
why not steal the good stuff
in the kitchen

  
where nothing is poisoned

  
First of all we are not thieves

  
Secondly stay out of the kitchen
and away from the humans

  
Its dangerous

  
I know
Im supposed to hate humans

  
but theres something about them

  
They dont just survive
They discover they create

  
I mean
just look at what they do with food

  
GUS TEAU ON TV
How can I describe it

  
Good food is like music you can taste
color you can smell

  
There is excellence all around you

  
You need only be aware to stop
and savor it

  
Oh Gusteau was right

  
Oh mmm yeah

  
Oh amazing

  
Each flavor was totally unique

  
But combine one flavor with another

  
and something new was created

  
So now I had a secret life

  
The only one who knew about it
was Emile

  
Hey Emile Emile

  
I found a mushroom

  
Come on youre good at hiding food
Help me find a good place to put this

  
He doesnt understand me
but I can be myself around him

  
Why are you walking like that

  
I dont want to constantly
have to wash my paws

  
Did you ever think about how we walk
on the same paws

  
that we handle food with

  
You ever think about
what we put into our mouths

  
All the time

  
When I eat I dont want to taste
everywhere my paws have been

  
Well go ahead

  
But if Dad sees you walking like that
hes not going to like it

  
What have you got there

  
You found cheese

  
And not just any cheese
Tomme de chèvre de pays

  
That would go beautifully
with my mushroom

  
And

  
This rosemary This rosemary

  
with maybe with a few drops
from this sweet grass

  
Well throw it on the pile I guess
and then well You know

  
We dont want to throw this in
with the garbage This is special

  
But were supposed
to return to the colony

  
before sundown or
you know Dads gonna

  
Emile

  
There are possibilities
unexplored here

  
We got to cook this

  
Now exactly how we cook this
is the real question

  
Yeah

  
The key is to keep turning it

  
Get the smoky flavor nice and even

  
That storms getting closer

  
Hey Remy you think that maybe
we shouldnt be so

  
You got to taste this

  
This is Its got this kind of
Its burny melty

  
Its not really a smoky taste
Its a certain Its kind of like a

  
Its got like this baboom zap
kind of taste Dont you think

  
 What would you call that flavor
 Lightningy

  
Yeah Its lightningy
We got to do that again

  
Okay when the next storm comes
well go up on the roof

  
I know what this needs Saffron
A little saffron would make this

  
Saffron Why do I get the feeling

  
 its in the kitchen
 Its in the kitchen

  
Saffron
 Not good

  
Saffron

  
Dont like it Shes gonna wake up

  
Ive been down here a million times

  
She turns on the cooking channel
boom she never wakes up

  
Youve been here a million times

  
Im telling you saffron will be
just the thing Gusteau swears by it

  
Okay Whos Gusteau

  
Just the greatest chef in the world
Wrote this cookbook

  
Wait You read

  
 Well not excessively
 Oh man Does Dad know

  
You could fill a book a lot
of books with things Dad doesnt know

  
And they have which is why I read
Which is also our secret

  
I dont like secrets

  
All this cooking
and reading and TVwatching

  
while we read and cook

  
Its like youre involving me in crime
and I let you

  
Why do I let you

  
Whats taking those kids so long

  
Ah IAquila saffron Italian Huh

  
Gusteau says its excellent
Good thing the old lady is a food love

  
Forget mystique
This is about your cooking

  
Hey Thats Gusteau Emile look

  
Great cooking
is not for the faint of heart

  
Great cooking
is not for the faint of heart

  
You must be imaginative
strong hearted

  
You must try things that may not work

  
And you must not let anyone
define your limits

  
because of where you come from

  
Your only limit is your soul

  
What I say is true Anyone can cook
But only the fearless can be great

  
Pure poetry

  
But it was not to last

  
Gusteaus restaurant lost
one of its five stars

  
after a scathing review
by Frances top food critic Anton Ego

  
It was a severe blow to Gusteau

  
and the brokenhearted chef
died shortly afterwards

  
which according to tradition
meant the loss of another star

  
Gusteau is dead

  
Run

  
No youll lead her to the colony

to even attempt something
so monumentally idiotic

  
I should have you drawn

Ill do it I think the law is on my side

  
Larousse draw and quarter this man

 Ego
 Solene LeClaire

  
 LeClaire What did she say

Someone is asking about your soup

  
What are you playing at

  
Am I still fired

LeClaire likes it yeah
She made a point of telling you so

  
If she write a review to that effect

  
and find out you fired
the cook responsible

  
 Hes a garbage boy
 Who made something she liked

  
How can we claim to represent
the name of Gusteau

  
if we dont uphold
his most cherished belief

  
And what belief is that
Mademoiselle Tatou

  
Anyone can cook

  
Perhaps I have been a bit harsh
on our new garbage boy

  
He has taken a bold risk

  
and we should reward that
as Chef Gusteau would have

  
If he wishes
to swim in dangerous waters

  
who are we to deny him

  
 You were escaping
 Oh yeah

  
Since you have expressed
such an interest in his cooking career

  
you shall be responsible for it

  
Anyone else

  
Then back to work

  
You are either very lucky
or very unlucky

  
You will make the soup again
and this time Ill be paying attention

  
Very close attention

  
They think you might be a cook
But you know what I think Linguini

  
I think you are a sneaky
overreaching little

  
Rat

  
 Rat
Get the rat

  
Linguini Get something to trap it

  
Its getting away
Get it get it get it

  
 What should I do now
 Kill it

  
 Now

Do you know what would happen to us

  
if anyone knew
we had a rat in our kitchen

  
Theyd close us down

  
Our reputation is hanging by a thread
as it is

  
Take it away from here Far away
Kill it Dispose of it Go

  
Dont look at me like that
You arent the only one whos trapped

  
They expect me to cook it again

  
I mean Im not ambitious
I wasnt trying to cook

  
I was just trying to stay out of trouble

  
Youre the one who was getting fancy
with the spices

  
What did you throw in there Oregano
No What Rosemary

  
Thats a spice isnt it Rosemary

  
You didnt throw rosemary in there

  
Then what was all the flipping

Look its delicious But dont steal
Ill buy some spices okay

  
Oh no Were going to be late
And on the first day

  
Come on Little Chef

  
Though I like many other critic

  
had written off Gusteau as irrelevant
since the great chefs death

  
the soup was a revelation
A spicy yet subtle taste experience

  
 Solene LeClaire
 Yes

  
Against all odds
Gusteaus has recaptured our attention

  
Only time will tell if they deserve it

  
Well

  
You know

  
Look I know its stupid and weird
but neither of us can do this alone

  
so we got to do it together right
You with me

  
So lets do this thing

Welcome to hell
Now recreate the soup

  
Take as much time as you need

You son of a

  
You got

  
This is not going to work Little Chef

  
Im going to lose it
if we do this anymore

  
Weve got to figure out something else

  
Something that doesnt involve
any biting or nipping

  
or running up and down my body
with your little rat feet

  
The biting No Scampering No

  
No scampering or scurrying
Understand Little Chef

  
Little Chef

  
Oh youre hungry

  
Okay So lets think this out

  
You know how to cook
and I know how to appear

  
human

  
We need to work out a system
so that I do what you want

  
in a way that doesnt look like
Im being controlled by a tiny rat chef

  
Would you listen to me Im insane
Im insane Im insane

  
In a refrigerator talking to a rat
about cooking in a gourmet restaurant

  
 I will never pull this off
 Linguini

  
We gotta communicate

  
I cant be constantly checking
for a yes or no head shake from a

  
The rat I saw it

  
 A rat
 Yes a rat Right next to you

  
What are you doing in here

  
Im just familiarizing myself with
you know the vegetables and such

  
Get out

  
One can get too familiar
with vegetables you know

  
That was close Are you okay up there

  
How did you do that

  
Thats strangely involuntary

  
One look and I knew
we had the same crazy idea

  
Okay

  
Where are you taking me Wait

  
Wait Im sorry

  
Okay

  
Okay

  
À votre santé

  
All right

  
That should do it

  
Congratulations You were able to
repeat your accidental success

  
But youll need to know more than soup
if you are to survive in my kitchen boy

  
Colette will be responsible for
teaching you how we do things here

  
Listen I just want you to know

  
how honored I am
to be studying under such

  
No You listen I just want you to know
exactly who you are dealing with

  
How many women
do you see in this kitchen

  
Well I

  
 Only me Why do you think that is
 Well I

  
Because haute cuisine
is an antiquated hierarchy

  
built upon rules
written by stupid old men

  
Rules designed to make it impossible
for women to enter this world

  
But still Im here How did this happen

  
Because well because you

  
Because I am the toughest cook
in this kitchen

  
Ive worked too hard
for too long to get here

  
and I am not going to jeopardize it
for some garbage boy who got lucky

  
Got it

  
Easy to cook Easy
to eat Gusteau makes Chinese food

  
Chineeasy

  
 Excellent work François as usual
 Its good isnt it

  
I want you to work up something
for my latest frozen food concept

  
Gusteaus Corn Puppies

  
Theyre like corn dogs only smaller
Bite size

  
What are corn dogs

  
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried You know American

  
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried You know American

  
Whip something up

  
Maybe Gusteau in overalls
and Huckleberry Tom hat

  
Or as a big ear of corn
in doggie makeup

  
Yes
But please with dignity

  
Get my lawyer

  
Well the will stipulates

  
that if after a period of two years
from the date of death

  
no heir appears

  
Gusteaus business interests
will pass to his sous chef You

  
I know what the will stipulates

  
What I want to know is if this letter
If this boy changes anything

  
Theres not much resemblance

  
Theres no resemblance at all
He is not Gusteaus son

  
Gusteau had no children
and what of the timing of all this

  
The deadline in the will
expires in less than a month

  
Suddenly
some boy arrives with a letter

  
from his recently deceased mother
claiming Gusteau is his father

  
Highly suspect

  
 This is Gusteaus
 Yes yes yes

  
 May I
 Of course

  
But the boy does not know

  
She claims she never told him
or Gusteau and asks that I not tell

  
 Why you What does she want
 A job for the boy

  
 Only a job
 Well yes

  
Then what are you worried about
If he works here

  
youll be able to keep an eye on him
while I do a little digging

  
Find out how much of this is real

  
I will need you
to collect some DNA samples

  
from the boy Hair maybe

  
Mark my words
The whole thing is highly suspect

  
He knows something

  
Relax hes a garbage boy
I think you can handle him

  
What are you doing

  
Im cutting vegetables
Im cutting vegetables

  
No You waste energy and time

  
You think cooking is a cute job
like Mommy in the kitchen

  
Well Mommy never had to face

  
the dinner rush when the orders
come flooding in

  
and every dish is different
and none are simple

  
and all of the different cooking times

  
but must arrive on the customers table

  
at exactly the same time
hot and perfect

  
Every second counts
and you cannot be Mommy

  
What is this Keep your station clear

  
When the meal rush comes
what will happen

  
Messy stations slow things down

  
Food doesnt go orders pile up
Disaster

  
Ill make this easy to remember

  
Keep your station clear
or I will kill you

  
Your sleeves
look like you threw up on them

  
Keep your hands and arms in
close to the body Like this See

  
Always return to this position

  
Cooks move fast Sharp utensils
hot metal keep your arms in

  
You will minimize cuts and burns
and keep your sleeves clean

  
Mark of a chef
Messy apron clean sleeves

  
I know the Gusteau style cold

  
In every dish Chef Gusteau
always has something unexpected

  
I will show you
I memorize all his recipe

  
 Always do something unexpected
 No Follow the recipe

  
 But you just said that
 No no no

  
It was his job to be unexpected
It is our job to

  
 Follow his recipes
 Follow the recipe

  
How do you tell how good bread is
without tasting it

  
Not the smell not the look
but the sound of the crust

  
Listen

  
Symphony of crackle
Only great bread sound this way

  
The only way to get the best produce
is to have first pick of the day

  
and there are only two way
to get first pick

  
Grow it yourself or bribe a grower

  
Voilà The best restaurant get first pick

  
People think haute cuisine is snooty

I killed a man with this thumb

  
Dont ever play cards

 I told them I would ask

  
This is simple

  
Just pull out an old Gusteau recipe

  
something we havent made
in a while

  
They know about the old stuff
They like Linguinis soup

  
They are asking for food from Linguini

  
A lot of customers like the soup
Thats all we are saying

  
Were we saying that

  
Very well If its Linguini they want

  
tell them Chef Linguini has prepared
something special for them

  
Something definitely off menu

  
Oh and dont forget to stress

  
 its Linguininess
 Oui chef

  
Now is your chance to try something
worthy of your talent Linguini

  
A forgotten favorite of the chefs
sweetbread à la Gusteau

  
 Colette will help you
 Oui chef

  
Now hurry up Our diners are hungry

  
Are you sure
That recipe was a disaster

  
Gusteau himself said so

  
Just the sort of challenge
a budding chef needs

  
Sweetbread à la Gusteau

  
Sweetbread cooked
in a seaweed salt crust

  
with cuttlefish tentacle
dog rose purée

  
geoduck egg dried white fungus

  
Anchovy licorice sauce

Good for you

  
I just took it to be polite
I dont really drink you know

of elephantine proportions

  
not to appreciate
this 61 Château Latour

  
And you Monsieur Linguini
are no idiot

  
Let us toast your nonidiocy

  
 Remy
 Emile

  
I cant believe it Youre alive

  
 You made it
 I thought Id never see you guys again

  
We figured

And what are you eating

  
I dont really know

  
I think it was
some sort of wrapper once

  
What No
Youre in Paris now baby My town

  
No brother of mine eats rejectamenta
in my town

  
Remy You are stealing
You told Linguini he could trust you

  
 And he can Its for my brother
 But the boy could lose his job

  
Which means I would too
Its under control okay

  
 More wine
 I shouldnt but Okay

  
So where did you train Linguini

  
Train All right

  
Surely you dont expect me to believe
this is your first time cooking

  
 Its not
 I knew it

  
Its my Second third fourth
Fifth time

  
Monday was my first time

  
But Ive taken out the garbage
lots of times before that

  
Yes yes Have some more wine

  
Tell me Linguini about your interests

  
Do you like animals

  
What
Animals What kind

  
The usual dogs cats horses

Now take a bite of No No No

  
 Dont just hork it down
 Too late

  
Here

  
Chew it slowly

 You detect that
 Oh Im detecting nuttiness

  
Close your eyes Now taste this

  
Whole different thing right
Sweet crisp slight tang on the finish

  
 Okay
 Now try them together

  
Okay

  
I think Im getting
a little something there

  
 It might be the nuttiness
 See

  
 Could be the tang
 Thats it

  
Now imagine every great taste
in the world

  
being combined
into infinite combinations

  
Tastes that no one has tried yet
Discoveries to be made

  
I think

  
 You lost me again

But that was interesting

  
Most interesting garbage I ever
Hey What are we doing

  
Dad doesnt know youre alive yet

  
Weve got to go to the colony
Everyone will be thrilled

  
 Yeah But
 What

  
Thing is I kind of have to

  
What do you have to

Whats more important here

  
Well I

  
It wouldnt hurt to visit

  
 Have you had a pet rat
 No

  
 Did you work in a lab with rats

Nopety nopety no

  
You know something about rats
You know you do

  
You know who know do whackadoo
Rattatatta

  
 Hey Why do they call it that
 What

  
Ratatouille Its like a stew right
Why do they call it that

  
If youre going to name a food

  
you should give it a name
that sounds delicious

  
Ratatouille doesnt sound delicious
It sounds like rat and patootie

  
Rat patootie
Which does not sound delicious

  
Regrettably we are all out of wine

  
My son has returned

  
And finding someone to replace you
for poison checker has been a disaster

  
Nothings been poisoned thank God
but it hasnt been easy

  
 You didnt make it easy
 I know I am sorry Dad

  
Well the important thing
is that youre home

  
Yeah well about that

  
You look thin Why is that

  
A shortage of food
or a surplus of snobbery

  
Its tough out there in the big world
all alone isnt it

  
Sure but its not like Im a kid anymore

  
 Hey Hey boy Whats up
 I can take care of myself

  
Ive found a nice spot not far away

Nothing like a cold splash of reality
to make you

  
 Visit
 I will I promise Often

  
 Youre not staying
 No Its not a big deal Dad I just

  
You didnt think
I was going to stay forever did you

  
Eventually
a birds got to leave the nest

  
Were not birds Were rats

  
We dont leave our nests
We make them bigger

  
 Well maybe Im a different kind of rat
 Maybe youre not a rat at all

  
Maybe thats a good thing

  
Hey The bands

Rats All we do is take Dad

  
Im tired of taking
I want to make things

  
I want to add something to this world

  
 Youre talking like a human

Wait You want me to stay and clean

  
Is that a problem

  
 No
 Good boy See you tomorrow

  
Were here

  
Take a good long look Remy

  
Now this is what happens

  
when a rat gets
a little too comfortable around humans

  
The world we live in
belongs to the enemy

  
We must live carefully

  
We look out for our own kind Remy

  
When all is said and done
were all weve got

  
 No
 What

  
No Dad I dont believe it
Youre telling me that the future is

  
Can only be more of this

  
This is the way things are
You cant change nature

  
Change is nature Dad
The part that we can influence

  
And it starts when we decide

  
 Where you going
 With luck forward

  
Hey Yeah

  
Stop it

  
Good morning

  
Good morning

  
So the chef
he invited you in for a drink

  
Thats big

  
Thats big What did he say

  
What

  
What you cant tell me

  
Forgive me for intruding on your deep
personal relationship with the chef

  
Oh I see how it is

  
You get me to teach you
a few kitchen tricks

  
to dazzle the boss
and then you blow past me

  
Wake up Wake up

  
I thought you were different

  
I thought you thought I was different

  
I thought

  
I didnt have to help you

  
If I looked out only for myself
I would have let you drown

  
But

  
I wanted you to succeed I liked you

  
My mistake

  
Colette Wait wait Colette

  
Its over Little Chef
I cant do it anymore

  
Colette Wait wait
Dont motorcycle away

  
Look Im no good with words
Im no good with food either

  
At least not without your help

  
I hate false modesty
Its just another way to lie

  
 You have talent
 No but I dont Really Its not me

  
When I added that extra ingredient

  
instead of following the recipe
like you said

  
That wasnt me either

  
 What do you mean
 I mean I wouldnt have done that

  
I wouldve followed the recipe

  
I wouldve followed your advice

  
I wouldve followed your advice
to the ends of the earth

  
 Because I love your advice
 But

  
But I

  
Dont do it

  
I have a secret Its sort of disturbing

  
 I have a
 What You

  
 I have a ra
 You have a rash

  
No no no I have this
This tiny little

  
Little

  
A tiny chef
who tells me what to do

  
A tiny chef

  
Yes Yes Hes

  
 Hes up here
 In your brain

  
Why is it so hard to talk to you
Okay Here we go

  
You inspire me Im going to risk it all

  
Im going to risk looking like the
biggest idiot psycho youve ever seen

  
You want to know why
Im such a fast learner

  
You want to know why
Im such a great cook

  
Dont laugh Im going to show you

  
No No

  
 What is it Ambrister
 Gusteaus

  
 Finally closing is it
 No

  
 More financial trouble
 No its

  
Announced a new line
of microwave egg rolls

  
What What Spit it out

  
Its come back Its popular

  
 I havent reviewed Gusteaus in years
 No sir

  
My last review condemned it

  
 to the tourist trade
 Yes sir

  
I said Gusteau has finally
found his rightful place in history

  
right alongside
another equally famous chef

  
Monsieur Boyardee

  
Touché

  
That is where I left it
That was my last word

  
 The last word
 Yes

  
Then tell me Ambrister

  
how could it be popular

  
No no no no no no no

  
The DNA matches the timing works
everything checks out

  
He is Gusteaus son

  
This cant just happen
The whole thing is a setup

  
The boy knows

  
Look at him out there
pretending to be an idiot

  
Hes toying with my mind
like a cat with a ball of Something

  
 String
 Yes Playing dumb

  
 Taunting me with that rat
 Rat

  
Yes Hes consorting with it

  
Deliberately trying to make me think
its important

  
 The rat
 Exactly

  
Is the rat important

  
Of course not
He just wants me to think that it is

  
Oh I see the theatricality of it

  
A rat appears on the boys first night
I order him to kill it

  
And now he wants me
to see it everywhere

  
Its here No it isnt its here

  
Am I seeing things am I crazy
Is there a phantom rat or is there not

  
But oh no

  
I refuse to be sucked into
his little game of

  
Should I be concerned about this
About you

  
I cant fire him Hes getting attention

  
If I fire him now
everyone will wonder why

  
And the last thing I want
is people looking into this

  
What are you so worried about

  
Isnt it good to have the press

  
Isnt it good to have Gusteaus name
getting headlines

  
Not if theyre over his face

  
Gusteaus already has a face
and its fat and lovable and familiar

  
And it sells burritos
Millions and millions of burritos

  
The deadline passes in three days

  
Then you can fire him
whenever he ceases to be valuable

  
and no one will ever know

  
I was worried
about the hair sample you gave me

  
 I had to send them back to the lab
 Why

  
Because the first time it came back
identified as rodent hair

  
 No no no
 What

  
Try this Its better

  
Well because you

  
Rat

  
Disgusting little creatures

  
I was reminded
how fragile it all was

  
How the world really saw me

  
And it just kept getting better

Cheers ja

  
Chef Chef
Chef Linguini

  
Your rise has been meteoric
yet you have no formal training

  
What is the secret to your genius

  
Secret You want the truth

  
I am Gusteaus son
Its in my blood I guess

  
But you werent
aware of that fact until very recently

  
No

  
And it resulted in
your taking ownership of this restaurant

  
How did you find out

  
Well some part of me just knew

  
The Gusteau part

  
 Where do you get your inspiration
 Inspiration has many names

  
 Mine is named Colette
 What

  
Somethings stuck in my teeth

  
Health Inspector

  
I wish to report a rat infestation

  
Its taken over my

  
Gusteaus restaurant

  
Gusteaus eh

  
I can drop by Lets see
First opening is three months

  
It must happen now
Its a gourmet restaurant

  
Monsieur I have the information
If someone cancels Ill slot you in

  
But the rat
You must

  
It stole my documents

  
Its past opening time

  
He should have
finished an hour ago

  
Bonjour ma chérie
Join us

  
We were just talking
about my inspiration

  
Yes he calls it his tiny chef

  
Not that dearest I meant you

  
 Its him
 Ego

  
Anton Ego

  
Is that Ego

  
I cant believe it

  
 You are Monsieur Linguini
 Hello

  
Pardon me for interrupting
your premature celebration

  
but I thought it only fair
to give you a sporting chance

  
as you are new to this game

  
 Game
 Yes

  
And youve been playing
without an opponent

  
Which is as you may have guessed
against the rules

  
Youre Anton Ego

  
Youre slow
for someone in the fast lane

  
And youre thin
for someone who likes food

  
I dont like food I love it

  
If I dont love it I dont swallow

  
I will return tomorrow night
with high expectations

  
Pray you dont disappoint me

  
Listen we hate to be rude
but were French and its dinnertime

  
She meant to say
Its dinnertime and were French

  
Dont give me that look

  
You were distracting me
in front of the press

  
How am I supposed to concentrate with
you yanking on my hair all the time

  
And thats another thing

  
Your opinion isnt the only one
that matters here

  
Colette knows how to cook too
you know

  
All right thats it

  
You take a break Little Chef

  
Im not your puppet

  
and youre not
my puppetcontrolling guy

  
The rat is the cook

  
You cool off and get your mind right
Little Chef

  
You cool off and get your mind right
Little Chef

  
Ego is coming and I need to focus

  
You stupid

  
Wow I have never seen that before

  
Yeah its like youre his fluffy bunny
or something

  
Im sorry Remy

  
I know there are too many guys

  
 I tried to limit
 You know what

  
Its okay Ive been selfish

  
 You guys hungry
 Are you kidding

  
All right Dinners on me
Well go after closing time

  
 In fact
 Yeah

  
tell Dad to bring the whole clan

  
Little Chef

  
This is great Son
An inside job I see the appeal

  
Oof

  
Little Chef

  
Little Chef

  
Hey Little Chef

  
I thought you went back
to the apartment

  
Then when you werent there
I dont know

  
It didnt seem right to leave things
the way that we did so

  
Look I dont want to fight

  
Ive been under a lot of you know
pressure

  
A lot has changed
in not very much time you know

  
Im suddenly a Gusteau

  
And I got to be a Gusteau or you know

  
people will be disappointed

  
Its weird

  
You know Ive never
disappointed anyone before

  
because nobodys
ever expected anything of me

  
And the only reason
anyone expects anything from me now

  
is because of you

  
I havent been fair to you

  
Youve never failed me
and I should never forget that

  
Youve been a good friend

  
The most honorable friend
a guy could ever ask

  
What is this

  
Whats going on

  
What

  
Hey

  
Youre

  
Youre stealing food How could you

  
I thought you were my friend
I trusted you

  
Get out You and all your rat buddies

  
And dont come back

  
or Ill treat you the way restaurants
are supposed to treat pests

  
Youre right Dad Who am I kidding

  
We are what we are and were rats

  
Well hell leave soon
and now you know how to get in

  
Steal all you want

  
 Youre not coming
 Ive lost my appetite

  
Do you know
what you would like this evening sir

  
Yes
Id like your heart roasted on a spit

  
Come in

  
Todays the big day
You should say something to them

  
 Like what
 You are the boss Inspire them

  
Attention

  
Attention everyone

  
Tonight is a big night

  
Appetite is coming
and hes going to have a big ego

  
I mean Ego Hes coming The critic

  
And hes going to order something

  
Something from our menu

  
And well have to cook it
unless he orders something cold

  
Just cant leave it alone
can you

  
You really shouldnt be here
during restaurant hours Its not safe

  
Im hungry

  
And I dont need the inside food
to be happy

  
The key my friend is to not be picky

  
 Observe
 No wait

  
 Oh no No no What do we do
 Ill go get Dad

  
You might think you are a chef
but you are still only a rat

  
Sure he took away a star
last time he reviewed this place

  
Sure it probably killed Dad

  
 This is very bad juju right here
 But Ill tell you one thing

  
 Ego is here
 Ego He is here

  
Anton Ego is just another customer
Lets cook

  
Yeah Lets

  
Okay

  
So I have in mind
a simple arrangement

  
You will create for me a new line
of Chef Skinner frozen foods

  
And I in return will not kill you

  
Au revoir rat

  
Do you know
what you would like this evening sir

  
Yes I think I do

  
After reading a lot of overheated
puffery about your new cook

  
you know what Im craving

  
A little perspective

  
Thats it Id like some fresh clear
well seasoned perspective

  
Can you suggest
a good wine to go with that

  
 With what sir
 Perspective Fresh out I take it

  
I am

  
Very well
Since youre all out of perspective

  
and no one else
seems to have it in this bloody town

  
Ill make you a deal

  
You provide the food
Ill provide the perspective

  
Which would go nicely
with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947

  
Im afraid I

  
Your dinner selection

  
Tell your Chef Linguini that I want
whatever he dares to serve me

  
Tell him to hit me with his best shot

  
I will have whatever he is having

  
 So we have given up
 Why do you say that

  
We are in a cage inside the car trunk

  
awaiting a future
in frozen food products

  
No Im the one in a cage Ive given up

  
You are free

  
I am only as free
as you imagine me to be

  
As you are

  
Oh please Im sick of pretending
I pretend to be a rat for my father

  
I pretend to be a human
through Linguini

  
I pretend you exist
so I have someone to talk to

  
You only tell me stuff I already know

  
I know who I am
Why do I need you to tell me

  
Why do I need to pretend

  
But you dont Remy

  
You never did

  
No My other left

  
Dad Dad Im in here

  
Im inside the trunk What the

  
Dad

  
 Hey little brother
 Emile

  
I love you guys

  
Where are you going

  
Back to the restaurant
Theyll fail without me

  
 Why do you care
 Because Im a cook

  
Its your recipe

  
How can you not know
your own recipe

  
I didnt write it down It just came to me

  
Then make it come to you again ja
Because we cant serve this

  
Wheres my order

  
Cant we serve something else
Something I didnt invent

  
This is what theyre ordering

  
Make them order something else
Tell them were all out

  
We cannot be all out We just opened

  
I have another idea
What if we serve them what they order

  
We will make it
Just tell us what you did

  
I dont know what I did

  
We need to tell
the customers something

  
Then tell them Tell them

  
 Dont do it
 Remy Remy

  
Dont Stop
Theyll see you Stop

  
Were not talking about me
Were talking about what to do right

  
Rats

  
 Remy
 Get my knife

  
Dont touch him

  
Thanks for coming back Little Chef

  
I know this sounds insane but

  
Well
the truth sounds insane sometimes

  
But that doesnt mean its not

  
the truth

  
And the truth is I have no talent at all

  
But this rat
hes the one behind these recipes

  
Hes the cook The real cook
Hes been hiding under my toque

  
Hes been controlling my actions

  
Hes the reason I can cook the food
thats exciting everyone

  
The reason Ego is outside that door

  
Youve been giving me credit
for his gift

  
I know its a hard thing to believe

  
But hey you believed I could cook
right

  
Look this works
Its crazy but it works

  
We can be
the greatest restaurant in Paris

  
and this rat this brilliant Little Chef
can lead us there

  
What do you say You with me

  
Dad

  
Dad I dont know what to say

  
I was wrong about your friend
and about you

  
I dont want you to think
Im choosing this over family

  
I cant choose
between two halves of myself

  
Im not talking about cooking
Im talking about guts

  
This really means that much to you

  
Were not cooks but we are family

  
You tell us what to do

Dont boil the consommé

Colette wait Colette

  
 You came back Colette
 Dont say a word

  
If I think about it
I might change my mind

  
Just tell me what the rat wants to cook

  
Ratatouille Its a peasant dish

  
Are you sure
you want to serve this to Ego

  
What I am making ratatouille

  
Well how would you prepare it

  
Ratatouille They must be joking

  
No it cant be

  
Who cooked the ratatouille
I demand to know

  
I cant remember the last time

  
I asked a waiter
to give my compliments to the chef

  
And now I find myself
in the extraordinary position

  
of having my waiter be the chef

  
Thanks but Im just your waiter tonight

  
Then who do I thank for the meal

  
Excuse me a minute

  
You must be the chef

  
If you wish to meet the chef
you will have to wait

  
until all the other customer have gone

  
So be it

  
At first Ego thinks its a joke

  
But as Linguini explains
Egos smile disappears

  
He doesnt react
beyond asking an occasional question

  
And when the story is done
Ego stands thanks us for the meal

  
Thank you for the meal

  
 and leaves without another word

  
The following day his review appears

  
In many ways
the work of a critic is easy

  
We risk very little
yet enjoy a position over those

  
who offer up their work
and their selves to our judgment

  
We thrive on negative criticism
which is fun to write and to read

  
But the bitter truth we critics must face
is that in the grand scheme of things

  
the average piece of junk
is probably more meaningful

  
than our criticism designating it so

  
But there are times
when a critic truly risks something

  
and that is in the discovery
and defense of the new

  
The world is often unkind
to new talent new creations

  
The new needs friends

  
Last night
I experienced something new

  
an extraordinary meal
from a singularly unexpected source

  
To say that both the meal
and its maker

  
have challenged my preconceptions
about fine cooking

  
is a gross understatement

  
They have rocked me to my core

  
In the past I have made no secret
of my disdain

  
for Chef Gusteaus famous motto
Anyone can cook

  
But I realize only now
do I truly understand what he meant

  
Not everyone
can become a great artist

  
but a great artist
can come from anywhere

  
It is difficult to imagine
more humble origins

  
than those of the genius
now cooking at Gusteaus

  
who is in this critics opinion

  
nothing less
than the finest chef in France

  
I will be returning to Gusteaus soon
hungry for more

  
I will be returning to Gusteaus soon
hungry for more

  
It was a great night

  
 The happiest of my life

  
But the only thing predictable
about life is its unpredictability

  
Well we had to let Skinner
and the health inspector loose

  
and of course they ratted us out

  
The food didnt matter

  
Once it got out
there were rats in the kitchen

  
oh man the restaurant was closed

  
and Ego lost his job and his credibility

  
But dont feel too bad for him

  
Hes doing very well
as a small business investor

  
 He seems very happy
 How do you know

  


  
Got to go Dinner rush

  
You know how he likes it

  
Thanks Little Chef

  
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening

  
 Dont you always
 Which one would you like

  
Surprise me

  
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening

  
Hey believe me that story
gets better when I tell it okay
